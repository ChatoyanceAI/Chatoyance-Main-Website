							      	<p>A high-water mark is the highest peak in value that an investment fund or account has reached. This term is often used in the context of fund manager compensation, which is performance-based.</p>
<p>High-water marks ensure that investors do not have to pay performance fees for poor performance, but more importantly, guarantee that investors do not pay performance-based fees twice for the same amount of performance.</p>
 <p>As long as the fund has charged a performance fee, it cannot charge another performance fee the following months if the fund has not exceeded the previous highest peak in value that the fund or account has reached.</p>

							      	<p>A Percentage Allocation Management Module (PAMM) is a simple way of agglomerating funds from multiple investors together into a single pool for the fund to manage all of the accounts in this pool simultaneously as a large collective fund. The percentage of the fund that investors are allocated is directly proportional to how much they contributed to the fund against the total amount contributed.

							      <div class="panel-body">
							      	<p>Chatoyance employs the belief that successful trading is repeatable through the sound use of mathematics. Chatoyance employs quantitative methods that do not predict the direction of the market. We assume that the market is completely random and efficient and have worked around a proprietary methodology to be profitable in such a market, through the constant analysis of the derivative of market volatility, acceleration and inflection rather than predicting and betting on the market’s direction. We comply our model with extremely sound risk management capabilities and loss control. Our performance tests have shown that our strategy has been effective in returning an almost consistent profit and outperforms the index.
